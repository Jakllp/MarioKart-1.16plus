MarioKart
=========

This is a 1.16+ "fork" of the official repo for the MarioKart plugin by storm345 and stormdev
Same functionality as MarioKart 1.13+ but with custom Minecart textures.
For more detailed commit-notes refer to [Mariokart 1.13+](https://github.com/Jakllp/MarioKart-1.13plus))

WILL ONLY WORK WITH UCARS 1.13+ (v1.5 following)!
(Fork for that: [uCars 1.13+](https://github.com/Jakllp/ucars))

Other requirements:
- COAL_BLOCK needs to be road block when using road blocks (when using powerups)
